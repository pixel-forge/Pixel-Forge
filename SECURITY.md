# Security Policy

## Supported versions
We patch the latest minor of each actively maintained package. Older majors/minors may receive critical fixes at our discretion.

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please do **not** open a public issue.

- Use GitHub’s **Private vulnerability reporting** (if available), or
- Email: security@yourdomain.example (PGP optional)

Include:
- Affected package name and version(s)
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept
- Impact assessment (what can an attacker do?)

We aim to acknowledge within 72 hours and will coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline. When applicable, we’ll publish an advisory and a patched release.
